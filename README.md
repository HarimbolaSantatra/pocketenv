# Pocketenv

Pocketenv is a simple and lightweight tool to manage development workspace environments. It allows you to define and manage workspaces for your projects, and easily switch between them.

> [!NOTE]
> `Pocketenv Workspaces` are just Docker Containers with some preinstalled tools, volumes, and [vscode tunnel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) as an entry point.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pocketenv is still in development and not ready for production use.
